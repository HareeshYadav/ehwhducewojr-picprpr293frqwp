Alexander Graham Bell, (born March 3, 1847, Edinburgh, Scotland—died August 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada), Scottish-born American inventor, scientist, and teacher of the deaf whose foremost accomplishments were the invention
 of the telephone (1876) and the refinement of the phonograph (1886).
Alexander (“Graham” was not added until he was 11) was born to Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds. His mother was almost deaf, and his father taught elocution to the deaf, influencing Alexander’s later career choice as teacher of the deaf. At age 11 he entered the Royal High School at Edinburgh, but he did not enjoy the compulsory curriculum, and he left school at age 
15 without graduating. In 1865 the family moved to London. 
Alexander passed the entrance examinations for University College 
London in June 1868 and matriculated there in the autumn. However, 
he did not complete his studies, because in 1870 the Bell family moved again,
 this time immigrating to Canada after the deaths of Bell’s younger brother Edward in 1867 and older brother Melville in 
1870, both of tuberculosis. The family settled in Brantford, Ontario, but in April 1871 Alexander moved to Boston, where he taught
 at the Boston School for Deaf Mutes. He also taught at the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts, and at the 
American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut.

One of Bell’s students was Mabel Hubbard, daughter of Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a founder of the Clarke School. 
Mabel had become deaf at age five as a result of a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever. Bell began working with her in 1873, when 
she was 15 years old. Despite a 10-year age difference, they fell in love and were married on July 11, 1877. They had four children, 
Elsie (1878–1964), Marian (1880–1962), and two sons who died in infancy.
While pursuing his teaching profession, Bell also began researching methods to transmit several 
telegraph messages simultaneously over a single wire—a major focus of telegraph innovation at the
 time and one that ultimately led to Bell’s invention of the telephone.
 In 1868 Joseph Stearns had invented the duplex, a system that transmitted 
two messages simultaneously over a single wire. Western Union Telegraph Company, the 
dominant firm in the industry, acquired the rights to Stearns’s duplex and hired the 
noted inventor Thomas Edison to devise as many multiple-transmission methods as possible
 in order to block competitors from using them. Edison’s work culminated in the quadruplex, 
a system for sending four simultaneous telegraph messages over a single wire. Inventors then 
sought methods that could send more than four; some, including Bell and his great rival Elisha Gray, 
developed designs capable of subdividing a telegraph line into 10 or more channels. 
These so-called harmonic telegraphs used reeds or tuning forks that responded to specific acoustic frequencies. 
They worked well in the laboratory but proved unreliable in service.
Throughout his life, Bell sought to foster the advance of scientific knowledge. He supported the journal Science, 
which later became the official publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
He was one of the founders of the National Geographic Society in 1888 and succeeded his father-in-law, Gardiner Hubbard, 
as president of the society between 1898 and 1903. In that year his son-in-law, Gilbert H. Grosvenor, became editor in chief 
of the National Geographic Magazine. Bell died at his Nova Scotia estate, where he was buried.
